Development began in April 2014, when Sony Pictures acquired the film rights. Following multiple writer and director changes and the casting of Amy Schumer and later Anne Hathaway as Barbie, the rights were transferred to Warner Bros. Pictures in October 2018. Robbie was cast in 2019, after Gal Gadot turned down the role due to scheduling conflicts, and Gerwig was announced as director and co-writer with Baumbach in 2020. The rest of the cast were announced in early 2022. Filming took place primarily at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, in England and on the Venice Beach Skatepark in Los Angeles from March to July 2022.\\nBarbie premiered at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on July 9, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 21 by Warner Bros. Pictures. Its simultaneous release with Universal\\'s Oppenheimer led to the \"Barbenheimer\" cultural phenomenon, which encouraged audiences to see both films as a double feature.

The director uses the toy conglomerate's vast archive and successful products as tools to create a rich and weird material. The movie is a clever send-up of Barbie dolls and their legacy, featuring light-hearted jokes that poke fun at Mattel, the doll's lore, and the contradictions of our sexist society. The director's storytelling is impressive, and the film's humor is both lighthearted and chuckle-worthy. Gerwig's Barbieland, created by Sarah Greenwood and Jacqueline Durran, is a pink fever dream with funky compositions by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, bubblegum anthems by Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, and Ice Spice. The film features plastic trees and identical two-story Barbie dream homes, with flying being the preferred mode of transportation.

Stereotypical Barbie, with Ken, heads to real-world Los Angeles to find her little girl. The relationship between Barbies and their human owners is tenuously outlined, so it's best not to think too deeply about how it all works. Robbie's performance in Gerwig's Barbie highlights the tension between Barbie as an object and subject. Her expressive eyes and physical presence reveal the human world's forces, while her rigid presence in Barbieland suggests she's not less rigid in the real world. Despite the director's skill in capturing deeper themes, the film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest it ultimately serves a brand.

The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. \"Barbie\" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the \"corporate\" issue.
